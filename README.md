# Return-Instruction
The data set is stored in sample.rar and x86.rar, and can be used after decompression

The Machine folder saves the code of the classic machine learning model, 
Modify.py stores the model construction, Draw_picture.py stores the code for drawing the image, 
and the data reading function is stored in the read_data_RF.py under GetData.

The Neural folder stores the code for the deep learning model, 
the modification.py stores the model construction, Picture.py stores the code for drawing the image, 
and the data reading function is stored in read_data_NN.py under GetData.
